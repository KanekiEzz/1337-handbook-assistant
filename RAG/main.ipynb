Since 120 hours are required for a monthly housing benefit, falling below this limit may result in the suspension of your housing benefits until you meet the necessary LOGTIME requirements. However, for restaurant access, the target is 30 hours per week, so if you only miss 120 hours in a month, it would not automatically freeze your restaurant access as long as you catch up within that month. But, keep in mind that the \"Blackhole and Freeze rules\" do apply, so if you consistently fail to meet the LOGTIME requirements, there might be consequences for both housing and restaurant access.\n"
